# Tax Website

This repository contains a simple HTML page intended to serve as the starting point for a tax-related website. The current repository structure is minimal and consists of a single `index.html` file.

## Project Structure

```
Tax-Website/
├── index.html   # main HTML page (currently mostly empty)
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page.

At present, the page does not contain content. It can be used as a template or starting point for building out a tax information website. Feel free to modify `index.html` with your own content, styling, and scripts.
